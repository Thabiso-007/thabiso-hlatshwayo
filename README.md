## Introduction

```
I have created a straightforward website that serves as a platform for me to discuss my achievements, exhibit my abilities, and showcase the projects I have completed.

## Installing the project

Alright, to make sure everything goes smoothly, it's crucial to have nodejs installed on your machine. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript outside of a web browser. It's pretty neat! Once you've got that covered, open up your terminal (you know, that black box where you type in commands) and get ready for the next step. Just type in `npm install` and hit enter! This command will initiate the installation process of all the necessary packages and dependencies required by your project. Npm stands for "Node Package Manager," which is an incredibly handy tool for managing external libraries and modules in JavaScript projects. So sit back, relax, and let npm handle all the heavy lifting for you!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

### `npm start`

Runs a production `build` folder

### `npm run link`

It helps prevent bugs and allow us to write much more readable code
